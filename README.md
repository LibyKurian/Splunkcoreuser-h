## Basic definition
Splunk as a software platform that you can use to search, analyze and visualize machine generated data.

So we have sources for data from these hosts:
- computers
- sensors
- virtual machines
- web servers
- network devices etc.

These hosts would typically generate data that falls into multiple categories (machine generated data):
- fault management
- configuration management
- accounting
- performance
- security
- system logs
- application logs
- metrics
- tickets

To get insights from these data, we put it into centralized management tool that is Splunk, And Splunk mainly has two categories of components:

- Processing components
	1. indexers.
	2. forwarders
	3. search heads.
- Management components (manage the processing components)
	1. deployment server
	2. indexer cluster manager
	3. search head cluster deployer
	4. license manager
	5. monitoring console.
